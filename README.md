# Theory Climbing v2
Check it out here: [Link to your website]

### Overview
As someone who has been passionate about Rock Climbing for over 7 years now, Iâ€™ve always wanted to create my own clothing brand. This project has given me the opportunity to finally bring that vision to life. 

Theory Climbing was built by utilizing Supabase Authentication API and Stripe Checkout Sessions API. These RESTful APIS, allowed me to create a website with secure user authentication and a secure, stateless checkout experience. 

This is version 2.0 of my website, originally built with Next.js, I wanted to challenge myself and try and build it again, but better.
