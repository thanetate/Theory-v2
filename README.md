### Overview
As an avid rock climber with over 7 years of experience, Iâ€™ve always dreamed of creating my own clothing brand. This project has allowed me to finally bring that vision to life.

Theory Climbing v2 is the result of my passion for both climbing and web development. The website was built using a modern tech stack, including Supabase for secure authentication and Stripe Checkout for a smooth, stateless checkout experience.

This is version 2.0 of the website. Originally built with Next.js, I wanted to challenge myself and improve the project by rebuilding it with a more refined tech stack and a fresh approach.

### Tech Stack
Client - 

    1. React (TypeScript)

    2. Jotai (State Management Library)

Server -

    1. .NET Core (C#)
    
Database -
