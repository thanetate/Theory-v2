Deploying the server to Azure ->
* Note -> We didn't have to configure our own CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions, 
Azure has a prompt that will create that automatically. 

    1. Create an App Service
        * Make sure authentication is enabled.

    2. Configure Server to have the correct app name. ex: "theory-webapp"

    3. Download Publish Profile and put it into GitHub secrets. 

    4. Put Environment Variables In Azure
        * For nested variables do Root:Child.
        * Do not click the box, so that the Environment Variables are used for everything.
