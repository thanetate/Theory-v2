Deployment Documentation

Client Deployment ~
The client application is deployed on Vercel. The deployment is configured to automatically update whenever changes are pushed to the GitHub repository.

Steps to Deploy the Client Application
1. Create a Vercel Account
2. Connect GitHub Repository
3. Configure Build Settings 
    - test using "npm run build"
4. Ensure the following settings are correct
5. Set Environment Variables
6. Deploy

Server Deployment ~
The server application is deployed using github actions and azure. The deployment is configured to automatically update whenever changes are pushed to the GitHub repository.

Steps to Deploy the Server Application
1. Remove Swagger UI if statement
2. On Github, create an action (Create a workflow yourself)
    - A YAML file (YAML stands for YAML Ain't Markup Language) is a configuration file used to define the settings and structure for various tools and applications.
    
    Key Uses of YAML Files:
    1. Defining CI/CD Pipelines (e.g., GitHub Actions):
    2. Setting up the development environment.
    3. Installing dependencies.
    4. Running tests.
    5. Building the project.
    6. Deploying the application.
    7. Configuration Files for Applications or Tools:

    * If we had multiple projects within a single solution we would use a .sln file.
    * If we had a microservice architecture or wanted consistency with development, testing and production we would use a docker image. 
3. Now we need to deploy our app in the YAML file using Azure Publish Profile
4. Setup Azure App Service
    -resource group: app-theory-eastus-dev-001
    -name: app-theory-web
    -region: central canada 
    * make sure basic authentication is enabled or you cannot download publish profile
